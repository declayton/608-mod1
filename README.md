My notes and practice from Module 1
I actually took notes of the chapters on paper before I realized we were supposed to take notes here. 
Some keys would be to remember:
  Operators (+, -, *, /, //, **, %) and (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=), including their order of preference. 
  Statistical functions and their python shortcuts (min, max, sum, len, range).
  Keep in mind the Python libraries
  If statements
  Input statements
